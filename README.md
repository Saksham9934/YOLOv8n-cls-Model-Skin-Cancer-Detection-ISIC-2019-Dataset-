# YOLOv8n-cls-Model-Skin-Cancer-Detection-ISIC-2019-Dataset-

Here's a revised version of the README file, focusing only on the YOLOv8 model:

Project Title: Skin Cancer Detection using YOLOv8

Description:
This project utilizes the YOLOv8 model to detect skin cancer using the ISIC 2019 dataset. The implementation is in Python programming using Jupyter Notebook, aiming to improve early detection and diagnosis of skin cancer.

Features:

- Implementation of YOLOv8 model for skin cancer detection
- Utilization of the ISIC 2019 dataset for training and testing
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean average precision (mAP)

I am looking to collaborate on:

- Enhancing YOLOv8 model performance and accuracy
- Exploring transfer learning and fine-tuning pre-trained YOLOv8 models
- Integrating the model into a web application or mobile app for real-world use
- Expanding the dataset to include more diverse skin cancer images

Technologies Used:

- Python programming
- Jupyter Notebook
- YOLOv8 model
- ISIC 2019 dataset
- TensorFlow/Keras libraries

Getting Started:

- Clone the repository and install required libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
- Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the YOLOv8 model
- Explore the code and contribute your ideas!

Contributions:

- Bug fixes and code improvements
- New feature implementations (e.g., data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning)
- Documentation and README updates
